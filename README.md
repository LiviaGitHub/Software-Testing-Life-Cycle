# 📌 Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

Welcome to my repository! 🚀 Here, I share structured guides on essential topics related to **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)**. These resources aim to help QA engineers, developers, and teams improve their testing strategies and build high-quality software.

## Who Am I?

I am a Software Engineer with over 13 years of experience, having worked with manual testing across mobile, TV streaming, browsers, and POS systems.
I have a strong background in test automation, starting with Selenium, moving to Cucumber, then Cypress, and now specializing in Playwright. Along the way, I also gained experience in API testing. I am always keeping up to date with the latest automation frameworks to enhance my skills.
I am a big fan of Agile environments, which led me to obtain Scrum Master and Product Owner certifications to improve my processes within Agile teams.
I dedicate time to implementing and maintaining well-structured, organized, and stable automated testing pipelines, ensuring they are free of flaky tests and as easy to maintain as possible.
For that reason, I continuously work on improving my coding skills, focusing on JavaScript, Node.js, and TypeScript.
