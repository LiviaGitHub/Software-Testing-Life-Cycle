### **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**  

**Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)** is a **black-box testing technique** used to identify defects at the boundaries of input ranges rather than within the center. Since errors often occur at the edges of input domains, testing boundary values increases the likelihood of finding defects with minimal test cases.

### **How BVA Works**
- The principle behind BVA is that **errors are more likely to occur at the extreme boundaries** of input values rather than in the middle.
- Instead of testing all possible values in a range, we test the **minimum, just above minimum, nominal, just below maximum, and maximum values**.
- This technique is often used alongside **Equivalence Partitioning (EP)** to optimize test coverage.

### **Example 1: Age Input (Valid Range: 18â€“60)**
Let's say a system accepts age values between **18 and 60** (inclusive). The test cases would be:

| Test Case | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Below Minimum | 17 (Invalid) |
| Minimum Boundary | 18 (Valid) |
| Just Above Minimum | 19 (Valid) |
| Nominal Value | 30 (Valid) |
| Just Below Maximum | 59 (Valid) |
| Maximum Boundary | 60 (Valid) |
| Above Maximum | 61 (Invalid) |

This ensures that we check the system's behavior at critical points where failures are more likely.

### **Example 2: Password Length (Valid Range: 8â€“16 Characters)**
If a system requires passwords between **8 and 16 characters**, we test:

| Test Case | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Below Minimum | 7 chars (Invalid) |
| Minimum Boundary | 8 chars (Valid) |
| Just Above Minimum | 9 chars (Valid) |
| Nominal Value | 12 chars (Valid) |
| Just Below Maximum | 15 chars (Valid) |
| Maximum Boundary | 16 chars (Valid) |
| Above Maximum | 17 chars (Invalid) |

### **Example 3: Online Shopping Cart (Allowed Quantity: 1â€“5 Items)**
For an e-commerce website where users can buy between **1 and 5 items**, the test cases would be:

| Test Case | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Below Minimum | 0 (Invalid) |
| Minimum Boundary | 1 (Valid) |
| Just Above Minimum | 2 (Valid) |
| Nominal Value | 3 (Valid) |
| Just Below Maximum | 4 (Valid) |
| Maximum Boundary | 5 (Valid) |
| Above Maximum | 6 (Invalid) |

### **Why Use BVA?**
- **Efficient Testing**: Reduces the number of test cases while maintaining strong coverage.
- **High Defect Discovery Rate**: Since many defects occur at boundaries, BVA increases the likelihood of finding them.
- **Applicable Across Domains**: Can be used for numeric inputs, string lengths, date ranges, and more.
