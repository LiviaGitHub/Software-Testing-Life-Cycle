## Testing Quadrants Model

The **Testing Quadrants Model** is a framework created by Brian Marick to help teams understand and categorize different types of software tests. It divides tests into four quadrants based on the purpose and type of feedback they provide.

### ðŸ“Œ **The Four Quadrants**

#### **Quadrant Q1 (Bottom left) - Unit and Component Tests**
âœ… **Focus:** Support for the development team  
âœ… **Objective:** Technical tests to validate code and design  
âœ… **Examples:**  
- Unit tests  
- Component tests  
- Technical integration tests  

#### **Quadrant Q2 (Top left) - Automated Functional Tests and Technical Exploratory Testing**  
âœ… **Focus:** Support for the development team  
âœ… **Objective:** Verify if the software meets functional expectations  
âœ… **Examples:**  
- Automated acceptance tests (e.g., BDD)  
- Functional tests  
- Prototyping and technical exploratory analysis  

#### **Quadrant Q3 (Bottom right) - User Experience (UX) and Exploratory Tests**  
âœ… **Focus:** Support for the business  
âœ… **Objective:** User-based tests and real-world experience  
âœ… **Examples:**  
- Exploratory tests  
- Usability tests  
- Customer feedback sessions  

#### **Quadrant Q4 (Top right) - Non-Functional Tests (Performance, Security, etc.)**  
âœ… **Focus:** Support for the business  
âœ… **Objective:** Validate non-functional attributes of the software  
âœ… **Examples:**  
- Load and performance tests  
- Security tests  
- Compatibility tests  

### ðŸŽ¯ **Why Use the Testing Quadrants?**  
âœ” Helps balance automated and manual testing  
âœ” Directs testing efforts to meet different project needs  
âœ” Ensures comprehensive test coverage (functional and non-functional)
