# 🛠️ How to reduce bugs in production

After defining the objectives and scope—with the goal of reducing bugs in production and focusing on high-risk features —follow these steps to ensure effective testing and quality assurance.

## 📌 1. Assess the Existence and Quality of Test Cases  
✅ **Identify existing tests:** Check if test cases already cover the defined scope.  
📊 **Evaluate test coverage:** Use metrics like code coverage (e.g., via Jest Coverage) and functional coverage.  
🔍 **Review test quality:** Ensure test cases are relevant, well-written, and up to date.  
⚠️ **Identify gaps:** If critical areas lack test coverage, create a backlog for new test cases.  

## ✍️ 2. Create or Update Test Cases  
📝 **Write new test cases as needed:** Prioritize the most critical ones first.  
🛠️ **Improve existing test cases:** Refactor weak or poorly written tests.  
🐞 **Ensure tests for reported bugs:** Always add tests to prevent regressions.  

## 🤖 3. Automate and Integrate Tests  
⚙️ **Automate where it makes sense:** Expanding automation with Playwright can reduce manual effort.  
🚀 **Integrate into CI/CD:** Ensure that all relevant tests run automatically before deployment.  

## 🔄 4. Execute and Monitor  
🔁 **Run tests continuously:** Validate that changes do not introduce new issues.  
📉 **Analyze failures:** If tests fail, investigate whether it's a real bug or a false positive.  
📌 **Adjust as needed:** Update tests and processes based on results.  

### 🎯 **Key Takeaway**  
Validating the existence of test cases is an essential step, but simply having tests is not enough—you must ensure they are **effective** and **well-integrated** into the quality process.
